# What does this mod do?

This mod adds a more powerful endgame magazine for regular weapons, aircraft, and vehicles called Depleted Uranium Rounds. This mod may add more weapons and/or ammunition in the future.

Currently the bullet stats are as follows (subject to change):

- Damage: 20 physical
- Constructed in a Chemistry Plant
- Requires (per magazine)
    - 6 Iron Plate
    - 6 Coal
    - 6 Copper Plate
